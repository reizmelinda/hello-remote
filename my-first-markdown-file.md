# Hello Markdown!

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write Code
* Done!

Now you can be a wiz at this and code up stuff like `console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");`
Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
